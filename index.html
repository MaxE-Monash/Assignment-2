    <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">
      <p style="flex: 1;">
        The Visualization above displays the distribution of both <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(10, 12, 180, 1);">Private</span> and <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgb(209, 154, 16)">Public</span> Hospitals across the entirety of Australia alongside displaying the number of <span class="map_1_text"> Hospital Admissions per 1000 people </span>. 
        Typically, what we find  broadly is that Hospitals are most densely found in the most populous regions of the country. <span class="map_1_text">Sparser areas </span>like the <span class="map_1_text"> Northern Territory </span> or  <span class="map_1_text">Tasmania </span> have <span class="map_1_text">significantly fewer hospitals </span> compared to  <span class="map_1_text">Victoria</span> or <span class="map_1_text">New South Wales</span>
        <br> <br>
        <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(10, 12, 180, 1);">Private</span> <span class="map_1_text">ospitals are found closer towards larger metropolitan cities </span>. As there is likely to be a greater profit incentive to do so, alongside with an easier time finding staff. 
        This would explain why there is a large density of <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(10, 12, 180, 1);">Private</span> hospitals within these dense regions. 
        <br>
        Notably, Data for the <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(10, 12, 180, 1);">Private</span> sector was not present for <span class="map_1_text"> Northern Territory </span>, the <span class="map_1_text"> ACT </span>and <span class="map_1_text"> Tasmania </span>.
        </p>
      <p style="flex: 1; max-width: 80%; margin-right:3%">

        Interestingly, The <span class="map_1_text"> Northern Territory </span>was found to have the <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(45, 150, 77, 1);">highest amounts of admissions per 1000 thousand people </span>. With a value of  <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(45, 150, 77, 1);">740.36 admissions per thousand people </span>, within in the <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgb(209, 154, 16)">Public </span>sector. 
        This was significantly more than the second largest amount in the <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgb(209, 154, 16)">Public</span> sector, being <span class="map_1_text">Queensland </span> with approximately <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgb(123, 182, 57);">333.66 admissions per thousand people. </span> 
        <br> <br> <br>
        The difference may be caused by the lack of <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgba(10, 12, 180, 1);">Private</span> hospitals in the <span class="map_1_text"> Northern Territory </span>, causing more elective surgeries to also be covered by the <span class="map_1_text" style="color: rgb(209, 154, 16)">Public</span> hospitals, inflating admissions. 


        <br> <br>
        The Hospitals listed amongst the map are commonly listed as amongst the best in the entirety of Australia.

    <p class="right_text">The visualization on the left displays the overall trends of Health Expenditure per capita by Year, State and Population The overlying trends of the data has <span class="SA">Southern Australia </span>displaying the <span class="map_1_text">highest rates of Expenditure per capita until 2018</span>. Following 2018, the <span class="ACT">Australian Capital Territories</span>  rose by <span class="map_1_text">about 6 hundred dollars each year until 2020</span>.<br>
    <br> 
    <span class="SA">Southern Australia's </span> expenditure in 2016 was <span class="map_1_text">remarkably larger than all other states across all following and previous years</span>. This was due to a one-off development project occurring, causing expenditure per person to surge by ~1.6k.
    <br>
    <br>
    
    <span class="NT">Northern Territory </span> tended to have the least amount of expenditure, both overall and per person. <span class="map_1_text">2011 was the only year where expenditure was following the trends</span> of other states, with <span class="map_1_text">xpenditure being 7119.54 per person</span>. Following that year, <span class="map_1_text">there was a significant reduction in expenditure until 2016-2017</span>, where it once again began to fall. 
<br> <br>
Generally,  <span class="map_1_text">all other states expenditure seemed to form a line from ~7200-500$ per person in 2010, to ~8500$ in 2020. </span> This seems to suggest that perhaps smaller territories could be likely to be more variable in their expenditure.
